# web-scraper

## Getting Started

If you want to really inefficiently brouse eight listings from the futurology subreddit, you’ve come to the right place. Click scrape to “requisition” some new articles then head to the homepage by clicking “Go Home!”.

### How it Works

You can add notes, delete notes, delete articles, and … uhhh open and close the modal if you want.

### Prerequisites

It’s on Heroku so you good.

### Installing

I said you good!

## Running the tests

Try stuff, go wild. Let me know what happens.

## Built With

* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Makes my words different colors and looks impressive to noncoders. 10/10
* [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) - I too hate semicolons
* [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) - I use it like Frank’s Red Hot
* [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) - Where do you think this link goes?
* [mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) - Brings your remote information through a series of tubes to your terminal
* [cheerio](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cheerio) - Prolly the most cheerful addon I’ve used
* [express-handlebars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars) - Riding in the express lane without handlebars is a fool’s errand
* [handlebars-helper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/handlebars-helpers) - It’s like your dad running along beside your bike and yelling “You’re doing great son!” while you pedal furiously and everything is perfect and you feel like you can take on the world. But an NPM app.

## Contributing

Honestly this one was kind of a pain in the butt, but (teehee) it’s done now so YOU’RE TOO LATE TO HELP ME, YOU’RE ALL TOO LATE!!

## Versioning

Only the one version for now, but who knows what the future holds!

## License

This project is licensed under the MIT License. So it’s free and open and such. I think. Really not sure how the legal issues surrounding web-scraping work actually. Maybe you should look into that?

## Acknowledgments

* The “Soak Up The Sun” playlist on spotify has been doin’ some work for me while I worked on this, so I’d like to acknowledge … whoever they pay to populate playlists. Also my dog only complained like 10-12 times tops, which was pretty great. I’ve got a great dog *muwah!*
